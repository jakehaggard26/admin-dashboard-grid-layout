a# admin-dashboard-grid-layout

## Description
This project is a recreation of an administrator dashboard. The dashboard was created using both Flexbox and Grid. This is just a UI, the layout is responsive but the buttons do not do anything. I enjoyed this project as it was the first time I did a project using Grid, it's a fun CSS module that makes 2D layouts quite easy to make. A "fun" thing I did for the first was a CSS reset, I've read about this and how they help with consistency across browsers so I was excited to use one for the first time in a project. I also enjoyed the the challenge of creating this design, at first it seemed daunting but when breaking down the layout into sub-layouts. This was done in a divide-and-conquer type of way, divide the main layout into smaller ones and completeing those one at at time.

## Challenges Faced
Flexbox or Grid
  * During the creation of this there where many times in the project when I asked myself "Do I use Flexbox or Grid for this part?". At first this was a decision that I'd spend a lot of time on but the further along I got and the familiar I got with the two I felt those decisions coming easier than they did before.

Fixing the Bell
 * Adding the rotating bell icon feature was one I was a fan of. However, when rotating it looks slightly blurry so it lowers the quality of it. I think I fixed this but I've also been staring at a screen for many hours so it could be my eyes begging for a break :')
